Hi all! My name is Chenyang Ji, or you can call me Joanne. I am currently a second-year PhD student from [Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China. I am working with [Sharon Xuesong Wang](https://sharonxuesongwang.wordpress.com/) at DoA, and I also closely collaborate with [Guo Chen](http://www.pmo.cas.cn/sourcedb/cn/expert/202107/t20210715_6140677.html) at [Purple Mountain Observatory, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.pmo.cas.cn/).

As seen above, I am an $\color{Turquoise}{\boldsymbol{observer}}$🔭🛰 working on $\color{Goldenrod}{\boldsymbol{exoplanets}}$🌏! And my research interests include:

- **High-Resolution Spectroscopy in Exoplanet** (both detection and characterization)
